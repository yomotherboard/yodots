## cVimrc
My cVimrc (configuration) file for cVim (vim bindings for chrome).
The cVim project is no longer maintained by its owner, but it still works perfectly.

### Site-specific Behavior
cVim bindings can be mapped in a url-specific manner. These bindings can be set to execute Javascript scripts, allowing for powerful site-specific behavior/navigation.
